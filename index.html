                    <p>Full-Stack Java Software Developer</p>
                    <p>I started in the restuarant industry when I was sixteen and found that I really loved helping others solve the mystery of what's for dinner. </p>
                    <p>I quickly realized that I loved to be in a postion to lead others and could communicate effectively to get the best of everyone.  </p>
                    <p>This led me up the management career path through various roles over the years. </p>
                    <p>After many years of that experience I realized that I didn't like the work/life balance of the service industry. The people and work itself </p>
                    <p>were always great, but I didn't like not being at home with family and being stuck at work every weekend.</p>
                    <p>In high school I had taken a few java courses and really loved programming in them.  I've always had a natural intuitiveness with computers since I was young.</p>
                    <p>By expanding my knowledge of this useful skill I know that I can start a new career path that will allow me to have that work/life balance that I've dreamed of.</p>
